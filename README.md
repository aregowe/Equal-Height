Equal-Height
============

JS to make various elements of equal height regardless of content.

This JS grabs the height of 4 elements in a row, then sets them to be the tallest out of all the heights, delivering a uniform user experience rather than having lop-sided heights based on individual content.

This is especially helpful for listings of products where you want them to be uniform & in line with eachother.
